# Positive Time Reporting Tool For SOEEA
State Officials and Employees Ethics Act

This is a complete re-write from original sources, but still, would not have been possible without the examples and ideas from those who wrote before me.  Kudos.  I stand on the shoulders of giants.

# Requirements
* Python3
* The following dependencies will be installed by *setup.sh*
  * Grab (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/grab)
  * Exchangelib (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/exchangelib/)

# Installation
1. git clone https://github.com/ncsa/time_reporting.git
1. cd time_reporting
1. ./setup.sh

## Installation Troubleshooting
OpenSSL issues
```
pycurl: libcurl link-time ssl backend (<library>) is different from compile-time ssl backend (<library> or "none/other")
```
If you get an error similar to the above, edit `setup.sh` to export the specific `link-time` backend specified in the error message and try again.

# Usage
```
usage: ptr.py [-h] [--user USER] [--pwdfile PWDFILE] [-n] [-q] [-d] [-o]
              (--csv CSV | --exch | --list-overdue)

SEOAA Positive Time Reporting tool.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help         show this help message and exit
  --user USER        Username
  --pwdfile PWDFILE  Plain text passwd ***WARNING: for testing only***
  -n, --dryrun
  -q, --quiet
  -d, --debug
  -o, --once         Submit only one week, then exit.
  --csv CSV          Format: date,M,T,W,R,F (empty col means 8-hours worked
                     that day)
  --exch             Load data from Exchange
  --list-overdue     List overdue dates and exit

Set environment variable PYEXCH_REGEX to control matching of Exchange events.
Regex matching is always case-insensitive. Default value is
PYEXCH_REGEX=(sick|holiday|vacation|out of office|OOTO)
```

## List overdue dates
```
run.sh --list-overdue
```

## Submit overdue timesheets using data from Exchange
```
run.sh --exch
```

## Submit only one (oldest) overdue week
```
run.sh --exch -o 
```

## Check data without submitting (dry) run
```
run.sh --exch -n
```

## Submit overdue timesheets using data from CSV file
```
run.sh --csv /path/to/csvfile.csv
```

## Customize regular expression to match Exchange events
Regex is used to match events in Exchange that represent time not worked (such as
vacation, out of office, holiday, sick, etc...). Matching is always case
in-sensitive.  The regex searches the event *subject*.
```
export PYEXCH_REGEXP='(on holiday|PTO|personal)'
run.sh --exch --dryrun
```
